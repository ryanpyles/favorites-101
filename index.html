    <div id="aboutMe">
        <p>I was born in Baltimore, MD, lived from ages 8-14 in Fort Worth, TX; ages 14-19 in Overland Park, KS; I then joined the Navy, was stationed
            in Okinawa, JP for two years then I was transferred to San Diego/Camp Pendleton where I then was discharged in 2011. I moved to Italy for a 
            few months with a couple of stints in ZÃ¼rich, CH and Paris, FR. I then returned to Los Angeles, CA (West Hollywood) for about a year or so and 
            then ended up in Fort Lauderdale, FL via Atlanta, GA. I have lived in Miami, FL for 3 years and since November 2020, I have been living a nomadic 
            lifestyle, I have been from New York City, to Philadelphia, Baltimore, DC, Nashville, Knoxville, Atlanta, Cocoa (Fl), Orlando, Tampa and back to 
            Fort Lauderdale. So needless to say, I hate the question "Where are you from?"
